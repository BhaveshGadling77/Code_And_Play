## 🎯 What This Project Does

This project showcases three simple and engaging games developed using core web technologies. It aims to demonstrate understanding of:

- DOM manipulation
- User interactions
- Game logic
- UI/UX styling

The games included are:

1. **Guess the Number** – Try to guess the randomly selected number with hints.
2. **Rock Paper Scissors** – Play against the computer in a classic hand game.
3. **Tic Tac Toe** – A two-player game to mark Xs and Os and get three in a row.

A landing page (`Main_Page/index.html`) acts as the homepage, linking to all games.
